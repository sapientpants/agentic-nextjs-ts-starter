# GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m (CVE-2025-64718) - js-yaml prototype pollution
# Severity: MEDIUM (CVSS 5.3)
# Affects: js-yaml < 4.1.1 (via @changesets/parse@0.4.1)
# Risk Accepted: This vulnerability only affects parsing of UNTRUSTED YAML documents.
# Our usage: @changesets/parse only processes changeset files in .changeset/ which are:
#   - Developer-written source code (not user input)
#   - Committed to git and reviewed in PRs
#   - Part of our trusted codebase
# Status: Waiting for @changesets/parse to upgrade to js-yaml v4
#   - Latest @changesets/parse (0.4.1) still uses js-yaml ^3.13.1
#   - Even next version (1.0.0-next.1) uses js-yaml ^3.13.1
#   - js-yaml v4 has breaking API changes (safeLoad -> load)
# Alternative mitigation: Run Node with --disable-proto=delete flag
# Review: Re-evaluate when @changesets/parse releases js-yaml v4 support
