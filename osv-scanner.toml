[[IgnoredVulns]]
id = "GHSA-ffrw-9mx8-89p8"
# Reason: Low severity (CVSS 2.9) vulnerability in fast-redact
# - fast-redact is a transitive dependency of pino (logging library)
# - No fixed version available as of 2025-10-12
# - Risk: ReDoS in non-performance-critical paths
# - Mitigation: Not exploitable in our usage patterns (structured logging only)
# - Will re-evaluate when upstream releases a fix
# Issue: https://github.com/davidmarkclements/fast-redact/security/advisories

[[IgnoredVulns]]
id = "GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx"
# Reason: Medium severity (CVSS 6.1) vulnerability in validator.js
# - validator is a transitive dependency (exact usage path to be investigated)
# - No fixed version available as of 2025-10-14
# - Risk: URL parsing difference could lead to XSS/open redirect bypass
# - Mitigation: Project does not use validator's isURL() function for security-critical validation
# - Will re-evaluate when upstream releases a fix
# Issue: https://osv.dev/GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx

[[IgnoredVulns]]
id = "GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m"
# Reason: Medium severity (CVSS 5.3) prototype pollution vulnerability in js-yaml
# CVE: CVE-2025-64718
# - js-yaml < 4.1.1 is a transitive dependency via @changesets/parse@0.4.1
# - Fixed in js-yaml 4.1.1, but @changesets/parse does not support js-yaml v4
# - @changesets/parse uses deprecated safeLoad() API (removed in js-yaml v4)
# - Latest @changesets versions (including 3.0.0-next.1) still use js-yaml ^3.13.1
# - Risk: Prototype pollution only when parsing UNTRUSTED YAML documents
# - Mitigation: Our usage is SAFE - @changesets/parse only processes changeset files in .changeset/ which are:
#   * Developer-written source code (not user input)
#   * Committed to git and reviewed in PRs
#   * Part of our trusted codebase
# - Alternative mitigation: Run Node with --disable-proto=delete flag
# - Will re-evaluate when @changesets/parse releases js-yaml v4 support
# Issue: https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/security/advisories/GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m
